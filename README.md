# VillagerSaver
 Minecraft plugin for Spigot
 
Prevents the death of villagers from zombies. They will be always converted to zombie villagers so, worst case scenario the player can just heal them.
It preserves trades and updates reputation.

### New on 1.1.1:
World blacklist, usage:
- /villagersaver blacklistworld {world_name}
- /villagersaver unblacklistworld {world_name}

The blacklist is saved on /plugins/VillagerSaver/WorldBlackList.yml I do not recommend editing this file manually.
